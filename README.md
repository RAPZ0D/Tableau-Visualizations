# Tableau-Visualizations

Welcome to the Tableau Visualizations repository! This repository showcases various interactive visualizations created using Tableau. These projects were developed during my time in college as a personal project to enhance my skills in data visualization and analysis.

## About

In this repository, you'll find four project folders, each containing a unique set of Tableau visualizations. Additionally, there is a separate section dedicated to visualizations based on a large dataset of COVID-19 activity.

## Projects

I have worked on multiple projects in this repository, utilizing Tableau for creating interactive visualizations. Each project involved cleaning the dataset using Python before visualizing it through Tableau.

The repository contains various Tableau dashboards showcasing different visualizations and insights derived from the data. Additionally, I have included a large dataset related to COVID activity, which has been analyzed and visualized using Tableau.

All the folder contain the .twbx file which is tableau workbook, you can download it and view all my visualizations, also remember the covid activity dataset was really big so i had to compress it to a .zip file and upload it in Project 4 folder
