# Tableau-Visualizations

Welcome to the Tableau Visualizations repository! This repository showcases various interactive visualizations created using Tableau. These projects were developed during my time in college as a personal project to enhance my skills in data visualization and analysis.

## About

In this repository, you'll find four project folders, each containing a unique set of Tableau visualizations. Additionally, there is a separate section dedicated to visualizations based on a large dataset of COVID-19 activity.
